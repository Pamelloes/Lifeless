Lifeless 0.1

Lifeless is a Bukkit plugin that implements hardcore mode in SMP. Its goal is to integrate as seemlessly
as possible, so that the end user can switch to hardcore mode as if it was implemented directly. Currently,
hardcore mode can be reached via the vanilla /gamemode command with a gamemode of 2. In the future, there
will be support to set the default gamemode to hardcore in the server.properties file. A unique feature of
Lifeless is that unlike other plugins, when you die you aren't banned from the server. Instead, all of your
changes since the time you joined hardcore mode are undone. That way, you can keep on playing. Currently,
this is very buggy and any debug support would be greatly apreciated.
